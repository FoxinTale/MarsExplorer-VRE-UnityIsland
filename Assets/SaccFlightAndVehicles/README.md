# SaccFlightAndVehicles

This is a prefab for VRChat containing the vehicles I've made. It is made in such a way that people can use it to create their own vehicles by altering the prefabs.

As of version 1.5 it has become quite modular, allowing for much greator customization, and easy addition of custom code.
